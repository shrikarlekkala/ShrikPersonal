Input a video into our platform and make it ASL Accessible. Currently working with Boston University to make accurate ASL Translations using NLP and to make the avatar smoother + more lifelike. 

Got on a call with a father whose daughter cannot access video due to a hearing accessibility barrier, and built this.
