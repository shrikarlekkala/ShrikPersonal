Students can join the live translation off of a generated metafrazo link. Then we are able to broadcast multiple translation streams of the same presentation of lecture in different languages -- if someone wants to listen to a presentation in German, and switch to the Italian channel, they can seamlessly do so. Great for international presentations/conferences, streams, and classrooms. Only takes one click of a button from the user, we take care of the rest.

Future is to look at two way communication -- think of a zoom call with no translation limits. Two way speaking, preserving your own tone - voice - emotion.
