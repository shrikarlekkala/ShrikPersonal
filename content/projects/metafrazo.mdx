Everyone hates watching dubbed movies because the actors' lips are not synced with the audio, the voice actors sound nothing like the real actors, and there are even some scenes in Money Heist and Squid Game where multiple actors have the same voice actor. This is really annoying for all of us watching movies -- but imagine the millions of students that need to go through this on a daily basis because courses aren't taught in their language. Those problems that make movies "hard to watch" make students' lives harder and create langauge barriers. How do we make education accessible to students affected by language barriers?
Here is a 15 sec demo of our solution:

  <source src="/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

With this translation, professors voice is maintained through English to Spanish translation, his lips are perfectly synced to the new language, and any text on screen is translated while keeping the same font color, size, and style. 

My mission is to "democratize education" or allow education to be accessed by all. Many people in this world can achieve great things, but do not have the opportunity to do so due to a lack of localized education. This problem drives me.
